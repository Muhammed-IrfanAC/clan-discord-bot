# optional embed for a quick guide
optional_title= "Here is a quick guide"
optional_description= f"""Using the playlist system is simple! Just visit the channel where you'll find bases matching your TH level and strategies for taking them down.

Here’s how we operate:

{bullet_emoji} **Monthly Army Practice**: We’ve put together a list of top (meta) armies for each TH. Every month, we pick one for everyone to practice.

{bullet_emoji} **Availability Marker**: Mark your available times, and we’ll organize practice sessions around when most people can join. You’ll get a weekly ping to update your availability.

{bullet_emoji} **Practice Time**: You have two options:

  - Use the playlist system to access base links and strategies for the army of the month. Try to replicate the attack and post your screen recordings (whether you succeed or not) in your designated channel, then ping <@&1110472879356792919>.\n
  - Use your own base and practice with the army of the month, then share your screen recording.

*We’ll review your attacks and help you improve to get the best results!*

{bullet_emoji} **For Friendly Challenges**, you can challenge yourself or another clanmate. Just click the "challenge" button near the reinforcement request. The best part is, you don’t have to cook an army – you can instantly build and attack!"""
